This project was completed mostly in a one-month period 
during the Spring of 2016. Our idea was to create a remake 
of the classic StarFox64 game for Nintendo 64. 

1. Run on Safari
2. The movement keys are AWSD, and the pause key is P
3. We will send you a zip file

NOTE: We were able to achieve our objective of collision detection for obstacles. When the ship hits an obstacle the game automatically refreshes and starts over.
